"Surreal photomontage collage in the style of Max Ernst \
# Black and white Victorian engravings collaged together \
# A dinner table with a grandfather clock behind it, where a man hangs from the ceiling \
# An eye replaces where his head should be \
# Scale is wrong \
# Paper edges visible, glue marks, vintage print texture \
# Feels like a 1920s magazine illustration gone feral"
