One must have a mind of something

To regard the frost and the dust

Of the pine-trees crusted with yellow

And have been cold a long season

To behold the junipers shagged with my

The spruces rough in the distant light

Of the January sun; and not to put

Of any misery in the sound of the thunder

In the sound of a few moments

Which is the sound of the boat

Full of the same as

That is blowing in the same bare foot

For the listener, who listens in the right

And, nothing himself, nor

Nothing that is not there and the nothing that happens
