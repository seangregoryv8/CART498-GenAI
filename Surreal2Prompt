A grandfather clock floating through time with a man grabbing onto it, draped in a deep blue skin colour, with stars across his skin. His hair is flowing, but made up of folliage and particles. The void is black, but he brings out the only bits of light throughout. I want his face to be composed of various types of green folliage, with an arm extending outwards towards the right.
