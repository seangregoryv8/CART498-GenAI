"Surreal photomontage collage in the style of Max Ernst \
# Black and white Victorian engravings collaged together \
# A dinner table with a grandfather clock behind it and a man watching \
# Scale is wrong \
# Paper edges visible, glue marks, vintage print texture \
# Feels like a 1920s magazine illustration gone feral"
